Espresso is the heart and soul of coffee, delivering an intense and bold flavor in a concentrated shot. Created by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans, a true espresso showcases the essence of freshly roasted coffee. Served in a small demitasse cup, it is the base for various coffee drinks and stands tall on its own, boasting a distinctive layer of crema, a velvety froth, on top.
Ingredients: Finely ground coffee beans, hot water.
