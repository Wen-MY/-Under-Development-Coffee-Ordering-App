An indulgent Italian classic, the Affogato is a delightful coffee-based dessert. It starts with a scoop of rich vanilla gelato or ice cream, which is then lovingly drowned in a shot of freshly brewed espresso. The contrast between the hot espresso and cold gelato creates a harmonious blend of flavors, making it a perfect treat for coffee lovers with a sweet tooth.
Ingredients: Freshly brewed espresso, vanilla gelato or ice cream.
