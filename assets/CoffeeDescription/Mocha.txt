A delightful treat for chocolate and coffee lovers alike, the Mocha is a heavenly fusion of flavors. It starts with a shot of espresso, infused with steamed milk and rich chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. Optionally, it can be crowned with a dollop of whipped cream, adding a touch of decadence to this sweet and velvety coffee delight.
Ingredients: Freshly brewed espresso, chocolate syrup or cocoa powder, steamed milk, whipped cream (optional).
